# readme.md for coding exercise - api

##	Introduction

The objective of this exercise is to build an API back-end application to showcase your capabilities with back-end development relevant to our current project.

There are three main steps:
  - Create a .Net Core application to implement requirements described below.
  - Push to git repository of your choosing.
  - Send me the link to clone repository for review.

##  Database setup

- Create Northwind database by executing instnwnd.sql
- Create sp_Products stored procedure by executing sp_Products.sql

##  Functional Requirements

Create API endpoints to use sp_Products stored procedure
  - Select all products
  - Select active products
  - Select one product 
  - Add new product
  - Update products
  - Delete product


## Additional Requirements

  - Use .Net Core 2.2
  - Build with VS Code (Here is an [example tutorial](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/first-web-api?view=aspnetcore-2.2&tabs=visual-studio-code) that may be helpful)
  - Responses should return json data
  - Use [Postman](https://www.getpostman.com/) and create API requests to test each endpoint.
  - Save as a [Postman Collection](https://learning.getpostman.com/docs/postman/collections/intro_to_collections/) and export to json file.
  - HTTPS not required
  - Authentication not required


##	Evaluation Criteria

The exercise will be evaluated on the implementation of the following:  
  - Solution structure and organization
  - Simplicity - simple solutions are preferred
  - Approach to implementing data access
